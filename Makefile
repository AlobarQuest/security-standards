# Each block is scoped to the LANGUAGE present, gated on the per-language config
# marker that `init` vendors (python → pyproject.toml; ts → eslint.config.mjs /
# tsconfig.json / .prettierrc; shell → .shellcheckrc; node → package.json).
# Without this, a TS-only repo still ran pytest (exit 5, "no tests") and failed
# make check (Phase 6 finding L1). That language gating stays.
#
# WITHIN a present language the gate REFUSES: a missing tool is a hard error, not
# a "skipping" line. A gate that skips is a gate that attests — it reports success
# for work it did not do, and `make check` exiting 0 stops being evidence that
# anything ran. Measured cost of the old behaviour: infraops-mcp-server carried
# 524 passing tests across 59 files that its declared gate had never once
# executed, CI green throughout (WS-P2.24; the same fix factory-runner made to its
# own copy in WS-P2.20).
#
# Same rule for the runners: a test runner that collected NOTHING is a hard error
# too — unless the repo genuinely contains no tests, which is the one case in
# which "nothing ran" and "nothing to run" are distinguishable. That is what the
# *_TEST_FILES probes below decide.
#
# Tools are invoked by bare name and resolved from the repo-local .venv/bin and
# node_modules/.bin FIRST (see PATH), so "installed" means installed for THIS
# repo wherever a repo-local install exists — a global pytest cannot collect
# against the wrong interpreter while the repo's own environment is empty.

# refuse over the repo's OWN code, and infraops-mcp-server carries four vendored
# *.sh files under node_modules that no one in this portfolio can fix.

# The JS patterns name explicit script extensions rather than `*.test.*`, which
