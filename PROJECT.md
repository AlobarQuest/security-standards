## Backlog

- [ ] (P2) Scan ~/.codex for live secrets — open follow-up from the 2026-06-14 machine security-audit cutover. Codex's transcript store was never audited (only ~/.claude/projects was); known to have held credential transcript exposure. Run in a separate focused session. — added 2026-06-26
- [x] (P2) make install deploys bws-write-guard.sh into ~/.claude/hooks/ but doesn't give ~/.claude its own .security-scan-allow.toml, so the deployed hook's self-match (bws.bootstrap-token-not-inline, line 33 = the detection regex) BLOCKs whenever ~/.claude is self-scanned by the Stop gate. Fixed ad-hoc 2026-06-26 by hand-creating ~/.claude/.security-scan-allow.toml (gitignored, local-only). Durable fix: have the deploy install/maintain that allowlist. — added 2026-06-26; done 2026-06-28 (deploy/claude-home.security-scan-allow.toml now a governed deployed artifact → ~/.claude/.security-scan-allow.toml via make install)
- [ ] (P2) Build tooling to make Coolify/GitHub deploy-key (and credential) rotations bearable — the enabler Devon wants before clearing deferred key-rotation items. Should make 'rotate a deploy key + swap on Coolify + GitHub + redeploy + verify' a one-command, transcript-safe flow (no reading deploy logs, which leak the key). Unblocks the deferred veritok deploy-key rotation. — added 2026-06-26
